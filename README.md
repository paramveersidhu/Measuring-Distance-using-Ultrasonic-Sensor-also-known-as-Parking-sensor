# Measuring-Distance-using-Ultrasonic-Sensor-also-known-as-Parking-sensor
It is basically a parking assistance using during car parking 
In this project i used ultrasonic sensor which measuring a distance of a object and it turn on the leds according to the distance of object
let's say if distance of object from ultrasonic sensor is less than 5cm then it turn on the red led.
It turn on yellow led if distance is between 5cm and 20cm and for more than 20cm it turn on green led.
furthermore, we can also add buzzer which will work according to the distance of same like leds.
